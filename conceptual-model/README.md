# ESPD-EDM UML Data Model 

This folder contains the UML Data Model of the ESPD in _.eap_, _.xmi_ and _HTML_ format.
* The _.eap_ and _.xmi_ file include two views and diagrams: 
  * **Business oriented view (BOV)** aimed at facilitating the understanding of the model and the business context, with references to the technical model, and;
  * **Technically oriented view (TOV)** providing an UBL based schema with references to business oriented view and aligned with the eProcurement ontology.
* Folder **ESPD-data-model-html** contains the _HTML_ version of the UML Data Model. If you do not want to download the folder to view the model you can view it on the documentation page under [ESPD Data Model](https://docs.ted.europa.eu/ESPD-EDM/3.0.1/_attachments/ESPD-data-model-html/index.html).
