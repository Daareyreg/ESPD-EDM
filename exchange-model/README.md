# ESPD Exchange Data Model Java library

## Overview

The `exchange-model` Maven module contains the XML schemas used to generate the [JAXB](https://jaxb.java.net) annotated Java classes.
In the `bindings.xjb` configuration file we specify the desired XML namespace prefixes for the entities involved
in the generation of `ESPD-Request` or `ESPD-Response` entities and two [Joda-Time](http://www.joda.org/joda-time/) date and time adapters.

The [JAXB](https://jaxb.java.net) POJOs are generated by the [JAXB2 Maven plugin](https://java.net/projects/maven-jaxb2-plugin/pages/Home).
The plugin will add `toString`, `hashCode`, `equals` methods to the Java classes and also customize the XML namespace
prefixes provided in the sample above.

## Requirements

You need to have [Java Development Kit 7+](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) and [Maven 3](https://maven.apache.org) installed in order to use this library.
