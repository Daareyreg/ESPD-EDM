# ESPD Exchange Data Model Java library

## Overview

The `exchange-model` Maven module contains the XML schemas used to generate the [JAXB](https://jaxb.java.net) annotated Java classes.
In the `bindings.xjb` configuration file we specify the desired XML namespace prefixes for the entities involved
in the generation of `ESPD-Request` or `ESPD-Response` entities and two [Joda-Time](http://www.joda.org/joda-time/) date and time adapters.

The [JAXB](https://jaxb.java.net) POJOs are generated by the [JAXB2 Maven plugin](https://java.net/projects/maven-jaxb2-plugin/pages/Home).
The plugin will add `toString`, `hashCode`, `equals` methods to the Java classes and also customize the XML namespace
prefixes provided in the sample above.

## Requirements

You need to have [Java Development Kit 7+](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) and [Maven 3](https://maven.apache.org) installed in order to use this library.

## Installation

The recommended way to get started using the `exchange-model` in your Java project is with a dependency management system.

### With Maven

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>eu.europa.ec.grow.espd</groupId>
  <artifactId>exchange-model</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.2</version>
</dependency>
```

### With Gradle

```groovy
dependencies {
    compile("eu.europa.ec.grow.espd:exchange-model:1.0.2")
}
```
